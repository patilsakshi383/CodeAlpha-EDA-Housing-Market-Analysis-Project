## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-market-analysis.git
cd housing-market-analysis
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📚 Usage

### **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

1. Launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `notebook_hpW4A.ipynb` and run cells step-by-step.

### **Run the Interactive Dashboard**

If you have a dashboard Python script (e.g., `src/dashboard.py`):

```bash
python src/dashboard.py
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050` to view the dashboard.

### **View Generated HTML Reports**

Interactive HTML reports generated by the analysis can be viewed directly in your browser:

* [3D Housing Analysis](src/3d_housing_analysis.html)
* [Interactive Correlation](src/interactive_correlation.html)
* [Interactive Price Distribution](src/interactive_price_distribution.html)
* [Neighborhood Dashboard](src/neighborhood_dashboard.html)
